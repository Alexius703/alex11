    "## Canvas LMS: Assignment Links vs Custom Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "The Canvas LMS expects the assignment link to include URL encoded parameters since the request is sent to the External Tool as a POST request (in this case IllumiDesk is the External Tool). However, all characters (even those considered safe) after the domain and `next=` part should be URL encoded, such as the `/`, `&`, and `=` characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Custom Fields` text box in the App -> Settings section, on the other hand, does not expect all characters to be URL encoded. The `/` characters that are assigned as part of the query parameter values should be encoded, but not the `&` and `=` characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assignment Link**: creates a string value which represents an `Assignment` link by toggling the check box next to the `is_assignment_link` label. If unchecked, the tool will create a string to add to the Custom Field section.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Lab Link**: creates a string value which redirects the user to a `Jupyter Lab` workspace instead of the `Jupyter Classic` workspace.\n",
    "- **LTI Launches**: adds the route associated to the LTI 1.1 login handler. If disabled, it is assumed that the user is using the default authentication class bound to the root of the `domain_url` value.\n",
    "- **Default Values**: to avoid having to enter the same values in the widget's text fields on a repetitive basis, add the string values to the function's parameters. For example, the `branch` parameter defaults to `master`."
